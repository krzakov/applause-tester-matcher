Should work on  Java 8 >= as well.
* Docker >= 20 installed on your machine (tested on Docker version `20.10.7`, `build f0df350`)
* port `8080` should be available on your machine
## How to run
run bash script `run.sh` \
make sure you have exec access rights and you run the script from the root of the project

Swagger servers as frontend in that solution for the sake of brevity.
